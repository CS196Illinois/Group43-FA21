# PLAN


Sprint 1: Research listed ML and webscraping tools to decide which ones will be used for sprints 2-4. Setup necessary environments for rest of project.

Sprint 2: On the backend, try to find or build the model for the inappropriate flags for one platform, and test its validity and check if it is up to the standards of the project. On the frontend, create a basic chrome extension that can connect to a backend server.

Sprint 3: If the model is not ready, backend will do the same as sprint 2, while the frontend will continue improving on the extension i.e. improving the server and making it look nicer. If the model for one platform is ready, connect this model to the existing chrome extension and attempt to get a working product with the basic chrome extension.

Sprint 4: By now, the model should be ready. Do the same as sprint 3 in connecting it to the chrome extension. Then, the backend should work on expanding the model's usage to other platforms. The frontend should continue improving on the current UI and make it as clean and user-friendly as possible.
