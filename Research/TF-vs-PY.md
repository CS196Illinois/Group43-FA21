# TensorFlow

## Advantages:
1. Support and library management - Backed by google, frequent releases with new features, popularly used in production environments.
2. Open sourced - popular and available to broad range of users.
3. Data visualization - TensorBoard to visualize data graphically, easy debugging of nodes, reduces effort of looking at whole code, efficiently resolves nn.
4. Keras compatibility - compatible with keras, open source library for developing deep learning models.
5. Highly scalable - ability to develop on any kind of system.
6. compatibility - c++, Ruby, python, c#, javascript, swift.
7. architectural support - CPU, GPU, TPU. TPU allows it to be run efficiently on the cloud.

## Disadvantages:
1. Benchmark tests - computation speed is slower compared to other frameworks.
2. Dependancy - every code needs to be executed using any platform for its support which increases dependancy for execution.
3. GPU support - only NVIDIA support for gpu and python support for gpu programming.

# Pytorch

## Advantages:
1. Based on python - highly pythonic, designed for deep integration in python code.
2. Easier to learn - syntax similar to python.
3. Debugging - can be debugged using python debugging tools.
4. Dynamic computational graphs - network behavior can be changed programatically at runtime.
5. Data parallelism easier on pytorch
6. Great community!

## Disadvantages:
1. Not great for use in real production work
2. Doesn't have it's own visualization interfaces like TF.
3. Not an end-to-end ML dev tool. Pytorch code needs to be converted to another framework like Caffe2 to deploy to servers, workstations & mobile devices.
